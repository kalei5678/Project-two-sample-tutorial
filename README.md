# Project-two-sample-tutorial
I am creating this repository to facilitate creating a tutorial for new R-users to learn some of the basics of data wrangling as an assignment for my data science class. The script from the movie Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is used as the data file in the tutorial and is attached as a .csv for this project.
