"763","harry","one, but it’s not powerful enough for all of them.",763,10
"764","ron","where’s hermione when you need her?",764,6
"765","harry","let’s go! arania exumai! go!",765,5
"766","harry, ron","whoah!",766,1
"767","ron","glad we’re out of there! ah- aaaah!",767,7
"768","harry","arania exumai!",768,2
"769","ron","thanks for that.",769,3
"770","harry","don’t mention it. get us out of here. now! come on! come on! move faster!",770,15
"771","harry, ron","aah!",771,1
"772","harry","go on! go! get us in the air.",772,8
"773","ron","the flying gear’s jammed!",773,4
"774","harry","come on! pull!",774,3
"775","ron","i’m trying!",775,2
"776","ron","follow the spiders! follow the spiders! if hagrid ever gets out of azkaban, i’ll kill him! i mean, what was the point of sending us in there? what have we found out?",776,32
"777","harry","we know one thing. hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets. he was innocent.",777,14
"778","harry","wish you were here hermione. we need you… now, more than ever.",778,12
"779","ron","what’s that?",779,2
"780","harry","ron, this is why hermione was in the library the day she was attacked. come on!",780,16
"781","harry","‘of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent’s eye. spiders flee before it.’ ron, this is it. the monster in the chamber of secrets is a basilisk. that’s why i can hear it speak. it’s a snake!",781,61
"782","ron","but if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one’s dead?",782,16
"783","harry","because no one did look it in the eye. not directly, at least. colin saw it through his camera. justin…justin must have seen the basilisk through nearly headless nick. nick got the full blast of it- but he’s a ghost- he couldn’t die again. and hermione…had the mirror. i bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along.",783,65
"784","ron","and mrs. norris? i’m pretty sure she didn’t have a camera or a mirror, harry.",784,15
"785","harry","the water. there was water on the floor that night. she only saw the basilisk’s reflection. ‘spiders flee before it.’ it all fits!",785,23
"786","ron","but how’s a basilisk been getting around? a dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.",786,16
"787","harry","hermione’s answered that, too.",787,4
"788","ron","pipes? it’s using the plumbing!",788,5
"789","harry","remember what aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? she died in a bathroom? what if she never left?",789,20
"790","ron","moaning myrtle.",790,2
"791","professor mcgonagall","all students are to return to their house dormitories at once. all teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately.",791,19
"792","professor mcgonagall","as you can see, the heir of slytherin has left another message. our worst fear has been realized. a student has been taken by the monster into the chamber itself. the students must be sent home. i’m afraid this is the end of hogwarts.",792,44
"793","professor lockhart","so sorry- dozed off- what have i missed?",793,8
"794","snape","a girl has been snatched by the monster, lockhart. your moment has come, at last.",794,15
"795","professor lockhart","my m-moment?",795,2
"796","snape","weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known all along where the entrance to the chamber of secrets is?",796,20
"797","professor mcgonagall","well, that’s settled. we’ll leave you to deal with the monster, gilderoy. your skills, after all, are a legend.",797,19
"798","professor lockhart","very well- ah- i’ll just be in my office getting, umgetting ready.",798,12
"799","madame pomfrey","who is it that the monster’s taken, minerva?",799,8

"802","harry","lockhart may be useless, but he’s going to try and get into the chamber. at least we can tell him what we know.",802,23
"803","harry","professor, we have some information for you! are you going somewhere?",803,11
"804","professor lockhart","uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go.",804,11
"805","ron","what about my sister?!",805,4
"806","professor lockhart","well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. no one regrets more than i.",806,13
"807","ron","you’re the defense against the dark arts teacher! you can’t go now!",807,12
"808","professor lockhart","well- i must say- when i took the job there was nothing in the job description about a…",808,18
"809","harry","you’re running away? after all that stuff you did in your books?",809,12
"810","professor lockhart","books can be misleading!",810,4
"811","harry","you wrote them!",811,3
"812","professor lockhart","my dear boy, do use your common sense! my books wouldn’t have sold half as well if people didn’t think i’d done all those things! harry",812,26
"813","ron","is there anything you can do?",813,6
"814","professor lockhart","yes, now you mention it. i’m rather gifted with memory charms. otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. and i’d never have sold another book. in fact, ah…i’m ah…going to have to do the same to you.",814,40
"815","harry","don’t even think about it.",815,5
"816","moaning myrtle","oh! who’s there? oh! hello, harry! ron. what do you want?",816,11
"817","harry","to ask you how you died.",817,6
"818","moaning myrtle","oh! it was dreadful. it happened right here in this very cubicle. i’d hidden because olive hornby was teasing me about my glasses. i was crying, and then i heard somebody come in.",818,33
"819","harry","who was it myrtle?",819,4
"820","moaning myrtle","i don’t know. i was distraught! huhh-huh…but they said something funny, a kind of made up language. and i realized it was a boy speaking, so i unlocked the door to tell him to go away and… i died. harry",820,40
"821","moaning myrtle","i just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes…over there, by that sink. ohhhhooo…",821,16
"822","harry","this is it. this is it, ron. i think this is the entrance to the chamber of secrets.",822,18
"823","ron","say something. harry, say something in parseltongue!",823,7
"824","harry","hesha- hassah.",824,2
"825","professor lockhart","excellent, harry. haa! good work! well then, i’ll just be, ah… there’s no need for me to stay.",825,18
"826","harry","oh, yes there is! you first.",826,6
"827","professor lockhart","now, boys what good will it do?",827,7
"828","ron","better you than us.",828,4
"829","professor lockhart","um…but…obviously, yes. sure you don’t want to test it first? no! aaaah! it’s really quite filthy down here.",829,18
"830","harry","all right. let’s go.",830,4
"831","moaning myrtle","oh, harry? if you die down there, you’re welcome to share my toilet. hee, hee.",831,15
"832","harry","uh…thanks myrtle.",832,2

"835","harry","now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.",835,10
"836","ron","go on.",836,2
"837","ron","what’s this?",837,2
"838","professor lockhart","it looks like a… snake.",838,5
"839","harry","it’s a snakeskin.",839,3
"840","ron","bloody hell. whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! heart of a lion, this one.",840,18
"841","professor lockhart","the adventure ends here, boys. but don’t fret. the world will know our story. how i was too late to save the girl. how you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. so, you first, mr. potter. say good-bye to your memories. obliviate!",841,48
"842","ron","harry! harry!",842,2

"848","ron","lockhart’s memory charm backfired. he hasn’t got a clue who he is!",848,12
"849","professor lockhart","it’s an odd sort of place this, isn’t it? do you live here?",849,13
"850","ron","no!",850,1
"851","professor lockhart","really? well?",851,2
"852","ron","what’ll do i do now?",852,5
"853","harry","you wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. i’ll go on and find ginny!",853,23
"854","ron","ok.",854,1

"856","harry","ginny… ginny! oh, ginny, please don’t be dead. wake up. wake up! please, wake up!",856,15

"858","harry","tom. tom riddle! what do you mean, ‘she won’t wake?’ she’s not…?",858,12
"859","tom riddle","she’s still alive, but only just.",859,6
"860","harry","are you a ghost?",860,4
"861","tom riddle","a memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.",861,9
"862","harry","she’s cold as ice. ginny, please don’t be dead. wake up! you’ve got to help me, tom. there’s a basilisk.",862,20
"863","tom riddle","it won’t come until it’s called.",863,6
"864","harry","give me my wand, tom.",864,5
"865","tom riddle","you won’t be needing it.",865,5
"866","harry","listen, we’ve got to go! we’ve got to save her!",866,10
"867","tom riddle","i’m afraid i can’t do that, harry. you see, as poor ginny grows weaker, i grow stronger. yes harry, it was ginny weasley who opened the chamber of secrets.",867,29
"868","harry","no. she couldn’t. she wouldn’t!",868,5
"869","tom riddle","it was ginny who set the basilisk on the mudbloods and filch’s cat, ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.",869,22
"870","harry","but why?",870,2
"871","tom riddle","because i told her to. you’ll find that i can be very persuasive. not that she knew what she was doing. she was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. still, the power of the diary began to scare her. and she tried to dispose of it in the girl’s bathroom. and then, who should find it, but you? the very person i was most anxious to meet.",871,69
"872","harry","but, why did you want to meet me?",872,8
"873","tom riddle","i knew i had to talk to you, meet you if i could. so i decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, hagrid, to gain your trust.",873,30
"874","harry","hagrid’s my friend! and you framed him, didn’t you?",874,9
"875","tom riddle","it was my word against hagrid’s. only dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.",875,14
"876","harry","i’ll bet dumbledore saw right through you.",876,7
"877","tom riddle","he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. i knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the chamber again while i was still at school, so i decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day i would be able to lead another to finish salazar slytherin’s noble work.",877,60
"878","harry","well, you haven’t finished it this time. in a few hours, the mandrake draught will be ready, and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.",878,27
"879","tom riddle","haven’t i told you? killing mudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore. for many months now, my new target… has been you. how is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? how did you escape with nothing but a scar, while lord voldemort’s powers were destroyed?",879,57
"880","harry","why do you care how i escaped? voldemort was after your time.",880,12
"881","tom riddle","voldemort is my past, present, and future. (writes in the air)",881,11
"882","tom marvolo riddle (rearranges) i am lord voldemort!",NA,882,1
"883","harry","you! you’re the heir of slytherin. you’re voldemort.",883,8
"884","tom riddle","surely, you didn’t think i was going to keep my filthy muggle father’s name? no. i fashioned myself a new name, a name i knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when i became the greatest sorcerer in the world.",884,42
"885","harry","albus dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!",885,9
"886","tom riddle","dumbledore’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!",886,13
"887","harry","he’ll never be gone! not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! fawkes?",887,16
"888","tom riddle","so, this is what dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. shearhas- samnathas- sélithaeine.",888,18
"889","tom riddle","let’s match the power of lord voldemort, heir of salazar slytherin, against the famous harry potter. sethae- he- this. parseltongue won’t save you now, potter. it only obeys me!",889,29
"890","tom riddle","no! your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!",890,14
"891","tom riddle","yes, potter, the process is nearly complete. in a few minutes ginny will be dead, and i will cease to be a memory. lord voldemort will return- very… much… alive!",891,30
"892","harry","ginny-",892,1
"893","tom riddle","remarkable isn’t it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? i’d guess you have little more than a minute to live. you’ll be with your dear mudblood mother soon, harry. funny, the damage a silly little book can do… especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. what are you doing? stop! no! ahhhh! ahhhh! ahhhh!",893,60
"894","harry","ginny…",894,1
"895","ginny","harry. it was me- but i swear, i didn’t mean to! riddle made me, and… harry, you’re hurt!",895,18
"896","harry","don’t worry. ginny, you need to get yourself out. follow the chamber, and you’ll find ron. you were brilliant, fawkes. i just wasn’t quick  enough… of course! phoenix tears have healing powers. thanks! it’s alright, ginny. it’s over. it’s just a memory.",896,42
"897","professor lockhart","amazing! this is just like magic!",897,6
"898","dumbledore","you both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?",898,19
"899","harry, ron","yes, sir.",899,2
"900","dumbledore","and there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.",900,10
"901","harry, ron","yes, sir.",901,2
"902","dumbledore","therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive special awards for services to the school.",902,16
"903","ron","thanks, sir!",903,2
"904","dumbledore","and now, mr. weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to azkaban? i believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. harry… first, i want to thank you, harry. you must have shown me real loyalty down in the chamber. nothing but that could have called fawkes to you. and, um… second, i sense that something is troubling you. am i right, harry?",904,66
"905","harry","it’s just… you see, sir i- i couldn’t help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between tom riddle and me.",905,21
"906","dumbledore","i see. well, you can speak parseltongue, harry. why? because lord voldemort can speak parseltongue. if i’m not mistaken, harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.",906,35
"907","harry","voldemort transferred some of his powers… to me?",907,8
"908","dumbledore","not intentionally, but yes.",908,4
"909","harry","so the sorting hat was right! i should be in slytherin.",909,11
"910","dumbledore","it’s true, harry. you possess many of the qualities that voldemort himself prizes. determination, resourcefulness, and if i may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. why then did the sorting hat place you in gryffindor?",910,37
"911","harry","because i asked it to.",911,5
"912","dumbledore","exactly, harry! exactly! which makes you different from voldemort. it is not our abilities that show what we truly are. it is our choices. if you want proof why you belong in gryffindor, then i suggest that you look more closely at this. be careful.",912,45
"913","harry","godric gryffindor.",913,2
"914","dumbledore","ah- it would take a true gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.",914,14
"915","dobby","um-humm…",915,1
"916","lucius malfoy","i’ll deal with you later. out of my way, potter! so, it’s true-- you have returned!",916,16
"917","dumbledore","when the governors learned that arthur weasley’s daughter was taken into the chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.",917,20
"918","lucius malfoy","ridiculous!",918,1
"919","dumbledore","curiously, lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.",919,27
"920","lucius malfoy","how dare you?!",920,3
"921","dumbledore","i beg your pardon?",921,4
"922","lucius malfoy","my sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. the culprit has been identified, i presume?",922,27
"923","dumbledore","oh, yes.",923,2
"924","lucius malfoy","and? who was it?",924,4
"925","dumbledore","voldemort.",925,1
"926","lucius malfoy","ah!",926,1
"927","dumbledore","only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this.",927,14
"928","lucius malfoy","i see.",928,2
"929","dumbledore","fortunately, our young mr. potter discovered it. one hopes that no more of lord voldemort’s old school things should find their way into innocent hands. the consequences for the one responsible would be severe.",929,34
"930","lucius malfoy","well, let us hope that mr. potter will always be around to save the day.",930,15
"931","harry","don’t worry. i will be.",931,5
"932","lucius malfoy","dumbledore. come, dobby. we’re leaving.",932,5

"934","harry","sir, i wonder if i could have that?",934,8

"936","lucius malfoy","mine? i don’t know what you’re talking about.",936,8
"937","harry","oh, i think you do, sir. i think you slipped the diary into ginny weasley’s cauldron, that day at diagon alley.",937,21
"938","lucius malfoy","you do, do you? why don’t you prove it? come, dobby. dobby!",938,12
"939","harry","open it.",939,2

"964","dumbledore","before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for professor sprout and madame pomfrey, whose mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been petrified. also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled.",964,48
